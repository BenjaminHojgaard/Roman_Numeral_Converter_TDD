# Assignment 1 / Roman_Numeral_Converter_TDD

## What was positive and good about using TDD?
When adding new functionality to the converter, it was nice to see that although the new test passed, it broke some of the previous tests. That could've been an error I wouldn't have spotted until later.
TDD helped me think about what I wanted to test, and as a result it made my actual code less prone to errors.

## What was annoying or difficult?
For example, when the test for the "V"'s would work, then the test for "I" would break, which meant I had to change the functionality. This happened a few times and was annoying at the time. With that said, without TDD I probably would have thought my program worked had I just continued coding without testing step by step.

## What surprised you?
How easy it was to break some of the previous code (shown as failed tests).

## Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thoughtof?
Yes. Certain edge cases like 0 or negative values. Normally I don't write any tests, and just assume that the consumer of the function knows what they're doing (as it's usually myself)
