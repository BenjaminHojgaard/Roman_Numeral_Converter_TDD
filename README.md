# Assignment 1 / Roman_Numeral_Converter_TDD

## What was positive and good about using TDD?
When adding new functionality to the converter, it was nice to see that although the new test passed, it broke some of the previous tests. That could've been an error I wouldn't have spotted until later.
TDD helped me think about what I wanted to test, and as a result it made my actual code less prone to errors.

## What was annoying or difficult?


## What surprised you?
How easy it was to break some of the previous code (shown as failed tests).

## Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thoughtof?
Yes. Certain edge cases like 0 or negative values.
